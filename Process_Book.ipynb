      "Inspired by the recent influx of news coverage of Ebola in the United States, we decided to investigate and conduct further research about Ebola in West Africa. Prior to this class, we all had interests in global health issues, and we thought this would be an incredible topic to explore that not only corresponds with our passions, but also would be relevant long after our project\u2019s conclusion. We noticed that the current fight against Ebola has been largely ineffective and disorganized, so we thought this may be due to a lack of understanding on how to best distribute the resources. We are hoping to parse through the data in a clear and methodical way that will help us figure out key factors that can prevent the spread of Ebola in the future. \n",

      "Ultimately we want to be able to predict the spread of Ebola, and determine which factors are most relevant in understanding this epidemic and its spread. Through this project, we hope to provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the data available on Ebola and use it to better inform health workers, governments, and NGOs, and provide actionable recommendations for future Ebola interventions based off of the analysis we conducted. The benefits from this project will be multifold. First, we will have a greater understanding of the epidemic and the factors which are most important in determining spread and also intervention. Next, we will also provide a service to the Ebola community, and take part in the fight against Ebola, serving as another resource to better and more efficiently allocate time and money towards this epidemic. \n"

Potential closures were excluded. Finally, datasets were grouped by country and region.\n"
